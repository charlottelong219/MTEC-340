#My Favorite Game: Journey
###Introduction
My favorite game is Journey, which is a very unique video game. The player is playing a robed traveler who navigates a vast desert, symboling life's journey towards a distant mountain peak. The game is completely following the style of minimalist with its storyline and music. In the game, the players does not have scores or levels to compete with each other but only to have each other. Journey invites players on a deeply introspective voyage and evokes a range of emotions from happy to heavy-hearted.
